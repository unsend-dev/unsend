# Docker Setup for Unsend

The following guide will walk you through setting up Unsend using Docker. You can choose between a production setup using Docker Compose or a standalone container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (if using the Docker Compose setup)

## Option 1: Production Docker Compose Setup

This setup includes PostgreSQL, Redis and the Unsend application.

1. Download the Docker Compose file from the Unsend repository: [compose.yml](https://github.com/unsend-dev/unsend/blob/main/docker/prod/compose.yml)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `compose.yml` file.
3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory. Copy the contents of `.env.selfhost.example`
4. Run the following command to start the containers:

```
docker-compose --env-file ./.env up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database, Redis and the Unsend application containers.

5. Access the Unsend application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Option 2: Standalone Docker Container

If you prefer to host the Unsend application on your container provider of choice, you can use the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub or GitHub's Package Registry. Note that you will need to provide your own database and SMTP host.

1. Pull the Unsend Docker image:

```
docker pull unsend/unsend
```

Or, if using GitHub's Package Registry:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/unsend-dev/unsend
```

2. Run the Docker container, providing the necessary environment variables for your database and SMTP host:

```
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL="<your-nextauth-url>"
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-nextauth-secret>"
  -e DATABASE_URL="<your-next-private-database-url>"
  -e REDIS_URL="<your-next-private-redis-url>"
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY="<your-next-private-aws-access-key-id>"
  -e AWS_SECRET_KEY="<your-next-private-aws-secret-access-key>"
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<your-next-private-aws-region>"
  -e GITHUB_ID="<your-next-private-github-id>"
  -e GITHUB_SECRET="<your-next-private-github-secret>"
  unsend/unsend
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database and aws details.

1. Access the Unsend application by visiting the URL you provided in the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable in your web browser.
