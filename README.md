## About this project
As most of email products out there, Unsend also uses Amazon SES under the hood to send emails. We provide an open and alternative way to send emails reliably and cheaply with a great dashboard. You can also use Unsend manage contacts and send bulk emails(newsletter, product updates etc). We will take care of the subscriptions.

Currently we only support emails, but we plan to expand to other sending protocols like SMS, push notification and even whatsapp.

We are currently in beta and trying to rollout to public slowly. If you're interested [join our waitlist](https://app.youform.io/forms/caja89vr) or drop in a message in discord.
