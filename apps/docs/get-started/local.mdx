## Introduction

Unsend's codebase is fully [open-source on github](https://github.com/unsend-dev/unsend)

Here is the codebase structure

  ``` 
apps
  ├── docs
  ├── marketing
  ├── web
packages
  ├── eslint-config
  ├── sdk
  ├── tailwind-config
  ├── typescript-config
  ├── ui 
  ```

The ```apps``` directory contains the code for:

- ```web```: Code for our dashboard and email infra

- ```marketing```: The code for the landing page of Unsend

- ```docs```: The documentation that you are currently reading.

The ```packages``` directory contains the code for:

- ```eslint-config```  package contains shared ESLint configuration settings

- ```sdk``` package contains typescript sdk for unsend rest api

- ```tailwind-config``` This package contains a shared Tailwind CSS configuration.

- ```typescript-config``` This package contains a shared typescript configuration

- ```ui``` This package is a collection of reusable UI components like buttons, badges, etc

## Running Unsend locally

To run Unsend, locally you will need to setup the following:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Free tier account will work.

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Free tier account will work.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) Recommended but not mandatory

## Fork and Clone the repo

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the repo">
    Click on the fork button on [Github](https://github.com/unsend-dev/unsend) to fork the repo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the repo">
  Once the repo is forked you can clone it on your local machine using:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/unsend.git
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install Dependencies

<Steps>
<Step>
```bash
corepack enable
```
</Step>

<Step>
```bash
pnpm install
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setup environment variables:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Copy the env.example file into .env">
    ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nextauth secret">
  Use the following command to generate a key and add it under ```NEXTAUTH_SECRET```

  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Github Oauth">

  Next, [create a new GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). This will allow you to sign in to Unsend with your GitHub account.4

  Add the homepage as:
  
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/login
  ```

  and callback URL as:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
  ```

  Once the app is added you can add the Client ID under ``GITHUB_ID``and CLIENT SECRET under ```GITHUB_SECRET```
  </Step>
    <Step title="Setup AWS credentials">

  Next, we need to add in the [AWS credentials](https://docs.unsend.dev/get-started/create-aws-credentials). Follow the detailed guide to get the AWS credentials with accurate permissions and add them in:
  
  ```
 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access-key-id>
 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret-access-key>
  ```

  Once the app is added you can add the Client ID under ``GITHUB_ID``and CLIENT SECRET under ```GITHUB_SECRET```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running Unsend locally
We are using a local Postgresql server and a local Redis server. But if you don't have docker you can also manually set these up.

### Option 1: Using Docker Recommended
<Steps>
<Step title="Start the dashboard">
```bash
pnpm d
```
</Step>
<Step title="Dashboard and Landing page will start running">
Dashboard will be started on
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
Landing page will be started on

```bash
http://localhost:3001
```
</Step>
<Step title="Once you login with Github you will be prompted with SES settings. You will need to run cloudflare tunnel to add the callback URL">
Run the following command to get the URL. Here is the more detailed guide by [cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/)
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

You can paste the URL provided by cloudflare in the Callback URL section

</Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Using your own database or hosted database
<Steps>
<Step title="Set up your PostgreSQL and Redis database in Environment Variables">
```bash
DATABASE_URL=""
REDIS_URL=""
```
</Step>
<Step title="Migrate the database">
```bash
pnpm db:migrate-dev
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start the development server">
```bash
pnpm dev
```
</Step>
<Step title="Once you login with Github you will be prompted with SES settings. You will need to run cloudflare tunnel to add the callback URL">
Run the following command to get the URL. Here is the more detailed guide by [cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/)
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

You can paste the URL provided by cloudflare in the Callback URL section

</Step>
</Steps>
