## Usage
Below is an example of how to use the Unsend package to send an email and retrieve email information.

### Initialize
Change the URL accordingly if you are using self self-hosted version of Unsend. The default URL will be https://app.unsend.dev.
```python

from unsendcommunity import Unsend

# Initialize the Unsend client
api_key = 'your-api-key'
client = Unsend(key=api_key, url='https://app.unsend.dev')

```

### Sending Emails
To send an email you will need to define the payload. After definition, you can use the ```.send_emails``` method to send emails with the payload as a parameter.

```python
payload = {
    "to": "youremail@gmail.com",
    "from": "hello@domainname.com",
    "subject": "Unsend test email",
    "text": "hello,\n\nUnsend is the best open source sending platform",
    "html": "<p>hello,</p><p>Unsend is the best open source sending platform</p><p>check out <a href='https://unsend.dev'>unsend.dev</a></p>",
}

# Send the email
response = client.send_email(payload)
print("Send Email Response:", response)
```
### Retrieve Emails using the id 
The email will be retrieved using the ID you get after sending the mail. 
```python
email_id = 'email-id-from-unsend'
email_response = client.get_email(email_id)
print("Get Email Response:", email_response)
```

The sample response of ``get_email`` is shown below:


```bash
{
  "data": {
    "id": "your-email-id",
    "teamId": 1,
    "to": [
      "yourmail@example.com"
    ],
    "from": "hello@mail.example.com",
    "subject": "Unsend test email",
    "html": "<p>hello,</p><p>Unsend is the best open source sending platform</p><p>check out <a href='https://unsend.dev'>unsend.dev</a></p>",
    "text": "hello,\n\nUnsend is the best open source sending platform",
    "createdAt": "2024-07-29T05:04:21.498Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T05:04:27.130Z",

        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "error": null
}
```
